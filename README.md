## Added Jupyter Notebook: CO2 Emission Dashboard

This commit adds the Jupyter Notebook file "CO2_emission.ipynb" which contains the code for an interactive dashboard built using Python and Panel. The dashboard visualizes CO2 emissions data and climate change trends, allowing users to explore and analyze the data interactively. 
The notebook includes data processing, visualization, and dashboard layout code. The data source is from the OWID CO2 Data repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv). The dashboard showcases the impact of CO2 emissions and the need for urgent action to address climate change.

Feel free to explore the notebook and interact with the dashboard. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
